            So everything started when i was a little younger, this passion about tecnology stuff, this website was made as a portfolio and to tell you who i truly am. Im'not the kind of guy who likes to expend the whole day playing videogames, don't get me wrong, i like that too, but the thing is i'm also hooken on sports, most of my weekends are at the beach, it's either surfing or playing futevolei with my friends.
